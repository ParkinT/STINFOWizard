STINFOWizard
============
STINFO is a specific US Military process that applies to documents of a Scientific and/or Technical nature.  It addresses the marking, control and destruction of documents and notes.  This is used for Unclassified material but includes Export control level markings, and so, provides similar safeguards.

While working on a contract for the US Air Force, I was faced with adding STINFO markings to existing documents when the initiative we first introduced.  In order to simplify the process - and aid others in the same situation - I developed this simple little utility.

The [single] .html file is a Windows HyperText Application (HTA).  It will run automatically in Windows and degrade to a simple HTML page in any browser (non-Windows OS).

I hope you find this useful.


{ There are numerous resources on the web that detail STINFO; if you are curious.}
